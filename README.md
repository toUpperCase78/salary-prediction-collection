# Collection of Salary Predictions

## Overview

This repo aims for which studies I've done to understand and gain insights about how salaries can be predicted against several different datasets. These include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualizations, feature engineering, predictions with Machine Learning regression models & comparisons, Explainable AI (XAI).

_More explanations and details will be written at a later time..._
